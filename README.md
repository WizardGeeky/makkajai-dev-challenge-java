# Makkajai Dev Challenge – Java Solutions

This repository contains my Java implementations for the **Makkajai Dev Sample Problems**.  
The solutions are designed to be **production-quality**, with clean object-oriented design, modular structure, and easy-to-understand code.

## 📌 Problems Implemented

### 1. Sales Tax
- Computes sales taxes and total costs based on item categories and import status.
- Supports rounding rules for tax calculations.
- Prints detailed receipts for given shopping baskets.

### 2. Game of Life
- Implements Conway’s Game of Life.
- Processes a given seed (list of live cell coordinates) and outputs the next generation.
- Supports still lifes, oscillators, and other standard patterns.

### 3. Conference Scheduler
- Automatically arranges talks into conference tracks.
- Each track contains a **morning session**, **lunch**, **afternoon session**, and **networking event**.
- Ensures valid scheduling rules (9AM start, lunch at 12PM, networking between 4–5PM).
